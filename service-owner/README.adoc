= Service Owner

Service Owners are accountable for the quality of their service. They apply a portfolio view, managing end-to-end services which include multiple products and channels. They operate at scale and provide the connection between multidisciplinary business areas and stakeholders. Service Owners ensure the necessary business processes are followed and participate in the governance of the service, including acting as a point of escalation for the delivery teams. They own the budget and allocate funding to areas of the service based on their decisions about priorities. They communicate the benefits and performance of their service, and are ultimately responsible for the successful operation and continuous improvement of the service.
