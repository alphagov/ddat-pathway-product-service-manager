=== Product manager

Product managers are responsible for the quality of their products. They use their knowledge of user needs and business goals to frame problems and set priorities for their delivery teams. They form the vision for their product and engage their teams and stakeholders in the development of that vision over time. Product managers keep people informed about the development of their products and promote their uptake. They represent users throughout the delivery process and use their feedback to inform continuous improvement.
 
=== Service Owner

Service Owners are accountable for the quality of their service. They apply a portfolio view, managing end-to-end services which include multiple products and channels. They operate at scale and provide the connection between multidisciplinary business areas and stakeholders. Service Owners ensure the necessary business processes are followed and participate in the governance of the service, including acting as a point of escalation for the delivery teams. They own the budget and allocate funding to areas of the service based on their decisions about priorities. They communicate the benefits and performance of their service, and are ultimately responsible for the successful operation and continuous improvement of the service.
